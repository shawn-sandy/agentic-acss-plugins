# /component-update

Usage: `/component-update <component-name>`

Example: `/component-update button`

Re-verifies an existing component reference doc against its captured fpkit ref,
surfaces any drift in the TSX or SCSS templates, and runs the canonical-shape
reviewer agent. Does NOT scaffold new components — use `/component-author` for
that.

## Steps

1. **Confirm the reference doc exists.**
   - Resolve `<component-name>` to
     `plugins/acss-kit/skills/components/references/components/<component-name>.md`.
   - If the file does not exist, halt and suggest
     `/acss-kit-component-author <component-name>` instead.

2. **Read the verification banner and Generation Contract.**
   - Capture `<ref>` from the `**Verified against fpkit source:**` line at the
     top of the file.
   - Capture `<export_name>`, `<file>`, `<scss>`, `<imports>`, `<dependencies>`
     from the Generation Contract.
   - Capture the existing `<divergences>` from the verification banner
     (everything after "Intentional divergences from upstream:").

3. **Fetch the upstream fpkit source at `<ref>`.**
   - Build the raw URL first:
     `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shawn-sandy/acss/<ref-as-tag-or-sha>/packages/fpkit/src/components/<component-name>/<component-name>.tsx`.
     The raw form returns the actual file contents; the
     `github.com/.../blob/...` form returns rendered HTML, which would corrupt
     the diff in step 4.
   - Use WebFetch on the raw URL. If the captured `<ref>` is
     `@fpkit/acss@<version>`, translate to the matching git tag (typically
     `v<version>` or `<version>`).
   - Repeat for the `.scss` companion if `<scss>` is not `(none)`, using the
     same raw URL form.
   - If WebFetch returns 404, try the alternate translated ref (e.g. `<version>`
     if `v<version>` failed) or verify the component path. If `<ref>` resolves
     to `"main"`, halt and ask the maintainer for a pinned tag or SHA — never
     construct a `blob/main` URL. Only as a last resort fall back to the rendered
     `https://github.com/shawn-sandy/acss/blob/<ref>/...` URL (with a pinned
     ref) and warn the maintainer that the diff may include HTML noise. If still
     404, surface the error and ask the maintainer for a corrected ref or path.

4. **Diff upstream vs local templates.**
   - Read the `## TSX Template` fenced block from the local reference doc.
   - Compare structurally to the upstream TSX (ignore the documented
     `<divergences>` — those are expected gaps).
   - Repeat for `## SCSS Template`.
   - Surface drift as a unified diff or section-by-section summary: "Upstream
     adds prop X", "Upstream renames hook Y", etc.

5. **Surface findings via AskUserQuestion.** Present the drift summary and ask
   the maintainer:
   - Is the upstream change intentional and should be applied? (If yes, edit the
     TSX/SCSS Template blocks to match.)
   - Does the verification banner need an updated divergence note? (If yes, edit
     the banner.)
   - Should the catalog row's Status be updated? (Default: keep current.) If the
     maintainer chooses "No drift detected", proceed to step 7 without edits.

6. **Apply approved edits.**
   - Use Edit to replace the TSX Template fence content if the maintainer
     approved an upstream pull.
   - Use Edit to replace the SCSS Template fence content if approved.
   - Use Edit to update the verification banner if `<divergences>` changed or
     the maintainer wants to bump `<ref>` to a newer tag.
   - Use Edit to update the catalog row in
     `plugins/acss-kit/skills/components/references/components/catalog.md` if
     the Status changed.

7. **Warn about export_name changes.** If the maintainer's edits changed
   `<export_name>` in the Generation Contract, print a prominent warning:

   > Changing `export_name` is a breaking change for existing `/kit-add`
   > consumers. The generated `<file>` will export a different identifier;
   > downstream imports will break on regenerate. Confirm this is intentional
   > before committing.

   Use Grep to scan `plugins/acss-kit/skills/components/SKILL.md` and the
   catalog for any other references to the old export_name and surface them.

8. **Run the reviewer agent.** Invoke `component-reference-reviewer` against the
   file. Surface its report inline.

9. **Print a summary.**
   - Files modified (or "No changes — no drift detected").
   - Reviewer agent verdict (PASS / N issues found).
   - Reminder if `<export_name>` changed: re-run any downstream consumers.

This skill does not bump the plugin version. After committing the reference doc
change, run `/release-plugin acss-kit <new-version>` if the change should ship.
