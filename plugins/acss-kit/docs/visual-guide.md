# acss-kit — Visual guide

> **Visual companion** to the prose docs. Diagrams orient; the canonical docs go deep. For a step-by-step linear walkthrough, read [tutorial.md](tutorial.md). For task-oriented snippets, read [recipes.md](recipes.md). For the mental model, read [concepts.md](concepts.md).

---

## 1. How to read this guide

Every section pairs a diagram (or two) with a short caption and a "Read the prose" link out to the canonical doc. Five visual formats appear below:

| Format | What it shows |
|---|---|
| Mermaid flowchart | A command's lifecycle — boxes are steps, arrows are transitions |
| Mermaid sequence diagram | An interaction over time — actors on top, time flowing down |
| Mermaid class diagram | The shape of a data structure — boxes are types, lines are relationships |
| ASCII tree | A directory layout — usually before / after a command |
| Hand-authored SVG or PNG | Architecture figures and terminal / browser screenshots |

Audience badges:

- **USER** — for developers who installed `acss-kit` and want to add components to their own app.
- **MAINTAINER** — for contributors editing the plugin itself.

> Diagrams version with the doc. If a slash command's interactive flow changes, the matching diagram changes in the same commit (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## 2. What is acss-kit?

![System overview: Claude Code on the left invokes the acss-kit plugin in the middle, which writes generated component files into the user's project on the right](assets/visual-guide/system-overview.svg)

The plugin lives outside your project. When you run `/kit-add <component>`, Claude Code loads the matching reference doc from inside the plugin, copies the polymorphic `ui.tsx` foundation into your project on first run, and writes a self-contained `.tsx` + `.scss` pair that you own outright. There is no `@fpkit/acss` runtime dependency in your bundle — the generated code is yours to edit.

> **Read the prose:** [concepts.md](concepts.md) for the full mental model and [README.md](README.md) for the index of every other doc.

## 3. Your first component (USER · simple)

The simplest example. Button has no component dependencies — only the shared `ui.tsx` foundation gets pulled in — so a single command produces a working component.

### The lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Dev as Developer
    participant CC as Claude Code
    participant Plugin as acss-kit (components skill)
    participant Project as Your project

    Dev->>CC: /kit-add button
    CC->>Plugin: Step A — first-run init
    Plugin->>Project: Read package.json (sass present?)
    alt sass missing
        Plugin-->>Dev: Halt — "npm install -D sass"
    end
    Plugin->>Project: Read .acss-target.json
    alt first run (file absent)
        Plugin->>Dev: "Where should components be generated?"
        Dev->>Plugin: src/components/fpkit/ (default)
        Plugin->>Project: Write .acss-target.json
        Plugin->>Project: Copy ui.tsx foundation
    end
    Plugin->>Plugin: Read component-button/reference.md
    Plugin->>Plugin: Resolve dependency tree (Button has none)
    Plugin->>Dev: Show plan — "Generating button/button.tsx + .scss"
    Dev->>Plugin: Confirm
    Plugin->>Project: Write button/button.tsx
    Plugin->>Project: Write button/button.scss
    Plugin-->>Dev: Summary + import snippet
```

### The file output

Before:

## 4. The component anatomy

Every component the plugin can generate is described by a `reference.md` in its own `skills/component-<name>/` skill directory. They all share the same nine-section shape, which keeps `/kit-add` parsing predictable and gives both audiences (users browsing, maintainers authoring) a consistent map.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ComponentReference {
        VerificationBanner : fpkit version + intentional divergences
        Overview : one-paragraph purpose
        GenerationContract : export_name, file, scss, imports, dependencies
        PropsInterface : TypeScript types
        TSXTemplate : fenced tsx block (verbatim into .tsx)
        CSSVariables : fenced scss block of custom properties
        SCSSTemplate : fenced scss block of selector rules (verbatim into .scss)
        Accessibility : WCAG 2.2 AA criteria addressed
        UsageExamples : fenced tsx import + usage snippets
    }
    class GeneratedComponent {
        +<name>.tsx
        +<name>.scss
    }
    ComponentReference --> GeneratedComponent : /kit-add produces
```

The **Generation Contract** is the only machine-readable section — `/kit-add` parses `export_name`, `file`, `scss`, `imports`, and `dependencies` to figure out which files to write and which dependencies to resolve. The other eight sections are read by Claude (and you) to make correct code-generation decisions.

> **Read the prose:** [`reference.md`](../skills/component-button/reference.md) for the canonical example, or [architecture.md — How to add a new component reference](architecture.md#how-to-add-a-new-component-reference) for the maintainer view.

---

## 5. Composing components (USER · advanced)

Most apps need more than a single Button. When you ask `/kit-add` for a component that has dependencies, the plugin walks the dependency tree and writes everything needed in one pass. Files that already exist are skipped, so your customizations survive re-runs.

The Form bundle is the most useful example. Requesting `/kit-add form` writes the full set of form controls (`Input`, `Textarea`, `Select`, `Checkbox`, `Toggle`) plus the shared `FormField` wrapper that handles label association, error messages, and `aria-describedby`.

### The dependency tree

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Form["Form (composite reference)"]
    Field["FormField (shared label / error wrapper)"]
    Input["Input"]
    Textarea["Textarea"]
    Select["Select"]
    Checkbox["Checkbox"]
    Toggle["Toggle"]
    UI["ui.tsx (polymorphic foundation)"]

    Form -->|exports| Input
    Form -->|exports| Textarea
    Form -->|exports| Select
    Form -->|exports| Checkbox
    Form -->|exports| Toggle
    Form -->|uses| Field
    Input -->|wraps| Field
    Textarea -->|wraps| Field
    Select -->|wraps| Field
    Field -->|renders via| UI
    Checkbox -->|renders via| UI
    Toggle -->|extends| Checkbox
```

`/kit-add` resolves bottom-up: `ui.tsx` first (if not already present), then `Field`, then each leaf control, then the composite `Form` itself.

### The file output

After `/kit-add form` (first run, no prior `/kit-add` in this project):

```text
src/components/fpkit/
├── ui.tsx
└── form/
    ├── form.tsx            # Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, Toggle, FormField (named exports)
    └── form.scss           # shared form / input / checkbox / toggle styles
```

If you previously generated `Button` and now run `/kit-add form`, the existing `button/` directory is untouched.

> **Read the prose:** [recipes.md](recipes.md) for first-run init, multi-component runs, and regeneration — and the [`form.md` reference](../skills/kit-core/references/form.md) for the full props matrix and accessibility notes.

## 6. Theming flow (USER · advanced)

Components ship with hardcoded CSS-variable fallbacks so they render the moment they land. Theming is purely additive: you generate a palette once and the components pick it up via `var(--color-primary, …)` references already in their SCSS.

### How a theme gets generated

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Dev as Developer
    participant CC as Claude Code
    participant Plugin as acss-kit (styles skill)
    participant Scripts as Python scripts
    participant Project as Your project

    Dev->>CC: /theme-create #7c3aed --mode=both
    CC->>Plugin: Invoke styles skill
    Plugin->>Scripts: generate_palette.py #7c3aed --mode=both
    Scripts-->>Plugin: JSON palette (15 required + 3 optional roles)
    Plugin->>Scripts: tokens_to_css.py --stdin --out-dir=src/styles/theme
    Scripts->>Project: Write light.css and dark.css
    Plugin->>Scripts: validate_theme.py src/styles/theme
    alt all 10 contrast pairs pass
        Scripts-->>Plugin: OK
    else any pair below threshold
        Scripts-->>Plugin: warnings (per failing pair)
    end
    Plugin-->>Dev: Summary — files + primary color + top contrast ratios

    Note over Dev,Project: Add a brand layer on top
    Dev->>CC: /theme-brand acme --from=#0066cc
    CC->>Plugin: Invoke styles skill (brand mode)
    Plugin->>Scripts: generate_palette.py #0066cc --mode=brand
    Plugin->>Project: Write brand-acme.css (import AFTER light.css + dark.css)
```

### The token pipeline (under the hood)

![Theming pipeline: role catalogue defines names, OKLCH palette algorithm computes values, validator checks WCAG contrast pairs, output writes CSS custom properties on :root and the data-theme dark selector](assets/visual-guide/theming-pipeline.svg)

Every theme file is just CSS custom properties — there is no JSON to maintain in your project. The schema is internal to the round-trip scripts; you author and edit `.css` directly.

> **Read the prose:** [styles SKILL.md](../skills/styles/SKILL.md) for all four flows (`/theme-create`, `/theme-brand`, `/theme-update`, `/theme-extract`) and [recipes.md](recipes.md) for common theming tasks.

## 7. Authoring a new component reference

<details>
<summary><strong>For plugin maintainers</strong> — click to expand</summary>

Adding a new component to the plugin means writing a new reference doc that follows the canonical nine-section shape. The `/component-author` maintainer skill scaffolds the structure; you fill in the per-component specifics from the upstream `shawn-sandy/acss` source.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start["maintainer wants to add a new component"]
    Author["/component-author &lt;name&gt;"]
    Validate["Validate kebab-case name<br/>no skills/component-&lt;name&gt;/ exists"]
    Scaffold["Scaffold skills/component-&lt;name&gt;/SKILL.md<br/>+ reference.md (9 sections + TODO markers)"]
    Fetch["Fetch upstream source from<br/>github.com/shawn-sandy/acss/blob/&lt;tag&gt;/<br/>packages/fpkit/src/&lt;name&gt;"]
    Fill["Fill TSX Template, SCSS Template,<br/>CSS Variables, Accessibility"]
    Tests["Run tests/run.sh"]
    Catalog["Update reference.md verification banner<br/>Status: New → Verified"]
    PR["Open PR"]

    Start --> Author
    Author --> Validate
    Validate --> Scaffold
    Scaffold --> Fetch
    Fetch --> Fill
    Fill --> Tests
    Tests -->|fail| Fill
    Tests -->|pass| Catalog
    Catalog --> PR
```

The validation gate (`tests/run.sh`) extracts the TSX and SCSS from the fenced code blocks and syntax-checks them, validates the SCSS contract (rem units, fallback-bearing `var()` calls, `[aria-disabled="true"]` selectors), runs WCAG contrast on the bundled themes, and replicates the manifest checks. A passing run looks roughly like:

```text
$ tests/run.sh

[1/6] wipe tests/.tmp/                                OK
[2/6] extract & syntax-check TSX from refs (18)       OK
[3/6] SCSS contract validation                        OK
[4/6] WCAG contrast on bundled themes                 OK
[5/6] manifest / structure replication                OK
[6/6] known-bad self-tests                            OK

All checks passed (≈ 28s).
```
