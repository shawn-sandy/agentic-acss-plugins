## For consumers

Developers using the plugin to generate fpkit-style components into their own projects.

| Guide | What it covers |

| [components/](components/README.md) | Per-component usage guides — add-command, import, props, examples, theming, and a11y for all 15 components |
| [styles.md](styles.md) | Consuming the theming system: theme commands, how generated `light.css`/`dark.css` are imported, and theme roles |
| [utilities.md](utilities.md) | Consuming the atomic-CSS utilities: `/utility-add`, class usage, breakpoints, and the token bridge |
| [visual-guide.md](visual-guide.md) | A diagrams-first portal: system overview, `/kit-add` lifecycle, component anatomy, composition, theming flow, and a gated maintainer track |
| [tutorial.md](tutorial.md) | A guided walkthrough: generate, import, and customize your first component |
| [concepts.md](concepts.md) | The mental model: UI base component, data-\* variants, CSS-var fallbacks, aria-disabled, generation flow, and the `.acss-target.json` config |
| [prompt-book.md](prompt-book.md) | Copy-paste catalogue of example prompts for every shipped slash command (also accessible in-session via `/prompt-book`) |
| [recipes.md](recipes.md) | Step-by-step walkthroughs for the most common tasks |

## For contributors

Developers maintaining or extending the plugin itself (SKILL.md, reference docs, component catalog).

| Guide | What it covers |
|-------|---------------|
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Plugin internals: SKILL.md structure, how to add a component reference, the `.acss-target.json` contract, version-bump checklist |
