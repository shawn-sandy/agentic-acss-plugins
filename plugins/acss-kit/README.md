# acss-kit

A Claude Code plugin for building accessible React applications with the [fpkit/acss](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/acss) design system. Generates components and CSS themes directly into your project — no `@fpkit/acss` npm package required.

## What you get

Fifteen per-component skills, a `kit-core` orchestrator, a `styles` skill, a `setup` skill, and a `style-tune` pilot:

- **`component-<name>`** (15 skills) — one dedicated skill per component (alert, button, card, checkbox, dialog, field, icon, icon-button, img, input, link, list, nav, popover, table). `/kit-add <component>` routes to the matching per-component skill, which reads its own `reference.md` for templates and writes self-contained TSX + SCSS into your project.
- **`kit-core`** — orchestrator for `/kit-create`, `/kit-list`, `/kit-sync`, `/kit-update`, and Form/HTML/Style-Tune modes. Does not auto-trigger for per-component requests.
- **`styles`** — CSS theme generation. `/theme-create`, `/theme-brand`, `/theme-update`, `/theme-extract` for OKLCH palettes with WCAG 2.2 AA validation.
- **`setup`** — cross-domain first-run skill backing `/setup`. Runs the sass check, copies `ui.tsx`, and seeds light/dark theme. Idempotent.
- **`style-tune`** — pilot per-feel skill that auto-triggers on phrases like "warmer button", "softer card", "tone down the primary". `/style-tune` is the explicit fallback. Routes between theme-role and component-SCSS edits with atomic WCAG pre-validation.

## Why

Installing `@fpkit/acss` from npm creates coupling: updates require package bumps, customization means forking or overriding, and the full bundle ships even if you only use a few components. This plugin uses fpkit component source as **reference material** and generates **self-contained implementations** that you own and can freely modify.

Generated components follow the same patterns as fpkit:

- Polymorphic `UI` base component (renders as any HTML element via the `as` prop)
- CSS custom properties with hardcoded fallbacks for zero-config theming
- `data-*` attribute selectors for variants (not BEM modifiers)
- `aria-disabled` pattern for WCAG 2.1.1 compliance on interactive elements
- TypeScript + SCSS with all sizes in rem units

## Migration from prior plugins

`acss-kit` consolidates and replaces four predecessors:

| Predecessor | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| `acss-kit-builder` | Rehomed into `acss-kit` (components skill + `component-form` pilot) |
| `acss-theme-builder` | Rehomed into `acss-kit` (styles skill) |
| `acss-app-builder` | Removed. Project init, page templates, layouts, patterns no longer included |
| `acss-component-specs` | Removed. Framework-agnostic specs not in scope |

If you have any of the old plugins installed:

```shell
/plugin uninstall acss-kit-builder
/plugin uninstall acss-theme-builder
/plugin uninstall acss-app-builder
/plugin uninstall acss-component-specs
/plugin install acss-kit@shawn-sandy-agentic-acss-plugins
```

Existing `.acss-target.json` files at project roots remain compatible — `/kit-add` reads the same shape.

### Upgrading from 0.10.x → 0.11.x

`acss-kit@0.11.0` added a vendored `foundation.css` (CSS reset, base typography, `@layer` cascade ordering). On the next `/kit-add` run in an existing project — where `ui.tsx` is present but `foundation.css` is absent — the skill prompts before copying it in alongside the SCSS source tree, so projects that intentionally avoid the foundation layer can opt out. See [`assets/foundation/SOURCE.md`](assets/foundation/SOURCE.md) for the upstream pin and the four documented patches (P1–P4).

## Prerequisites

- React + TypeScript project
- `sass` or `sass-embedded` in devDependencies (acss-kit will tell you the exact command if missing)

## Installation

```shell
/plugin marketplace add shawn-sandy/agentic-acss-plugins
/plugin install acss-kit@shawn-sandy-agentic-acss-plugins
```

## First-run setup

**Run `/setup` once after installing the plugin.** It front-loads the one-time configuration so subsequent `/kit-add` and `/theme-create` calls are pure generation.

```
/setup
```

What it does:

1. Detects your package manager from the lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `bun.lock`, `package-lock.json`).
2. Checks for `sass`/`sass-embedded` in `devDependencies`. If missing, prints the exact install command and stops — no side effects.
3. Writes `.acss-target.json` at your project root (or reuses existing).
4. Copies `ui.tsx` (the polymorphic foundation component) verbatim to your target directory.
5. Seeds `src/styles/theme/light.css` and `dark.css` from a prompt for a seed hex color.
6. Detects your project's main CSS/SCSS entry (`src/styles/index.scss`, `src/index.css`, `app/globals.css`, etc.), prompts you to pick when multiple candidates exist or to specify a path when none are found, and idempotently appends `@import` lines for the new theme files. The chosen file is recorded under `stack.cssEntryFile` in `.acss-target.json`.

Pass `--no-theme` to skip theme generation, or `--target=<dir>` to override the component output directory.

**Generated artifacts are committed — developer owns the code.** `.acss-target.json`, `src/components/fpkit/`, and `src/styles/theme/` should be in version control, not `.gitignore`.

`/setup` is idempotent: re-running it checks each artifact and skips anything already present.

If you delete `.acss-target.json`, re-run `/setup` to regenerate it. If your project originally used a custom `--target=<dir>`, pass it again — the regenerated file otherwise defaults to `src/components/fpkit/`.

## Component commands

### `/kit-list [component]`

List available components or inspect one without writing any files. Read-only — useful for discovering names, props, CSS variables, and dependencies before running `/kit-add`. As of `0.11.1`, the listing appends `[HTML]` to components whose static-HTML output is **Verified** (Button, Card, Alert, Dialog), and `/kit-list <name>` prints a dedicated `HTML output:` line so you can see at a glance whether `/kit-add --target=html` will succeed. The full reference (signature, examples, output shape) is in [`docs/prompt-book.md`](docs/prompt-book.md).

```
/kit-list
/kit-list dialog
```

### `/kit-add <component> [component2 ...]`

Generate one or more components into your project.

```
/kit-add badge
/kit-add button
/kit-add dialog
/kit-add button card alert
```

**What happens:**

1. **Init check** — verifies sass is in devDependencies; copies `ui.tsx` to your target directory if not already present. On first run (existing install without `foundation.css`), prompts to copy `foundation.css` + SCSS source tree — the CSS reset, base typography, and `@layer` cascade ordering that make components render correctly out of the box.
2. **Target directory** — runs `scripts/detect_target.py`. If `.acss-target.json` is missing, asks where to generate files (default: `src/components/fpkit/`).
3. **Stack detection** — runs `scripts/detect_stack.py` to classify framework (vite/next/remix/astro/cra), CSS pipeline, and entrypoint file; persists the result into `.acss-target.json` under a `stack` key.
4. **Dependency resolution** — reads the component's Generation Contract, walks the dependency tree recursively.
5. **Preview** — shows the full file tree that will be created and waits for confirmation.
6. **Bottom-up generation** — generates leaf dependencies first (e.g., `icon.tsx` before `icon-button.tsx` before `dialog.tsx`).
7. **Skip existing** — files that already exist are skipped and imported from instead of overwritten.
8. **Summary** — displays created/skipped files and an import/usage snippet.
9. **Verify integration** — runs `scripts/verify_integration.py` against the recorded `stack.entrypointFile`. Missing imports are surfaced as a numbered fix-up list; the plugin never auto-edits the entrypoint.

### `/kit-add --target=html <component> [component2 ...]`

Generate **static HTML** versions of components for projects that don't use React — server-rendered apps, static sites, design-system docs, email templates, prototypes. Reads the same component reference docs as the default React mode, but emits markup + SCSS + tiny vanilla JS instead of TSX.

```text
/kit-add --target=html button
/kit-add --target=html card alert
/kit-add --target=html dialog
/kit-add --target=html button card alert dialog
```

**Output for each component:**

- `<componentsHtmlDir>/<name>.html` — fragment markup. Same classes, `data-*` attributes, and ARIA as the React version, so the SCSS works unchanged. Slot placeholders are HTML comments (`<!-- slot: children -->`).
- `<componentsHtmlDir>/<name>.scss` — byte-identical to the React generator's SCSS (the framework-agnostic CSS is shared). Compile to `.css` with Sass (`npx sass <name>.scss <name>.css`) before referencing it from a `<link>` tag — browsers cannot load `.scss` directly.
- `<componentsHtmlDir>/<name>.js` — for components with runtime behavior: Button (aria-disabled wrap), Card (interactive variant — keyboard activation + `card:activate` event), Alert (dismiss + auto-hide + pause-on-hover), Dialog (showModal + backdrop close), plus Popover, Checkbox, Input, IconButton once their refs are augmented. Stateless components (Img, Link, Icon, List, Table, Field, Nav, plain Card) emit no `.js`. Plain ES module — no bundler required.

On first run, prompts for the target directory (default `components/html`), persists the choice to `.acss-html-target.json`, and copies the foundation helper `_stateful.js` into the target. After generation, runs `scripts/verify_integration.py --target=html` and reports any pages missing `<link rel="stylesheet">` / `<script src>` references.

The first batch of reference docs supporting `--target=html` is **Button**, **Card**, **Alert**, and **Dialog**. Remaining components fall through to a "not yet" warning until their `reference.md` is augmented with `## HTML Template` and `## Vanilla JS` sections.

### `/kit-create <description>`

Creator mode — generate any acss-kit component from a natural-language description. The underlying `component-creator` skill also auto-triggers on the same phrasing without the slash command.

```text
/kit-create primary pill button that says "Add to cart"
/kit-create soft warning alert titled "Heads up" with body "Your card expires next month"
/kit-create card with a heading "Plan" and content "Premium tier with all features"
/kit-create small outline icon-button with aria-label "Close"
```

Loads the matched component's reference doc at runtime, parses its `## Props Interface`, resolves the user's phrases against the declared prop set, and emits a paste-ready TSX snippet (default) or a standalone component file. Works with any component that has a dedicated per-component skill — Button, Alert, Card, Dialog, Link, Input, Field, Checkbox, IconButton, Img, Icon, List, Table, Popover, Nav. Refinement turns ("make it larger", "swap to secondary", "change the title to 'Save'") merge into the in-memory spec and re-emit. Full reference in [`docs/prompt-book.md`](docs/prompt-book.md).

### Auto-trigger: form generation

The `component-form` skill auto-triggers when you ask for a form in plain English:

> "Create a signup form with email, password, and a role select."

It derives the field list, runs `/kit-add field input button checkbox` if any of those aren't vendored yet, and writes a self-contained accessible form.

## Bulk install & safe updates

### `/kit-sync`

Bulk-install **every** shipped acss-kit component, the `ui.tsx` foundation, and a starter OKLCH theme into your project in one shot. Records each file's normalized sha256 in `<projectRoot>/.acss-kit/manifest.json` so future re-syncs and `/kit-update` runs can detect drift and preserve your edits.

```text
/kit-sync
/kit-sync --seed="#4f46e5"
/kit-sync --skip-styles
/kit-sync --target=src/ui/fpkit --styles-dir=src/styles
/kit-sync --dry-run
```

**What happens:**

1. **Preflight** — `detect_target.py` for project root, `detect_stack.py` for sass, `manifest_read.py` to detect re-sync.
2. **Enumerate + dedupe** — every component from `skills/component-*/SKILL.md` plus inline entries from `kit-core/references/inline-components.md`, with `dependencies:` resolved recursively.
3. **Plan** — shows the full file tree (foundation + components + styles + manifest) and waits for confirmation. `--dry-run` stops here.
4. **Generate** — components written bottom-up; foundation copied verbatim; theme generated from the seed hex (skipped under `--skip-styles`).
5. **Manifest** — every written file's normalized sha256 is recorded in `.acss-kit/manifest.json`.
6. **Verify integration** — `verify_integration.py` surfaces any missing imports.

If `.acss-kit/manifest.json` already exists, every file is routed through the `/kit-update` drift check before writing — modified files are skipped, clean files overwritten.

### `/kit-update [<component> ...]`

Safely re-copy unmodified files after an `acss-kit` plugin upgrade. Reads `.acss-kit/manifest.json`, computes drift via normalized sha256 comparison, and overwrites only files whose on-disk content still matches the recorded hash. Files you've edited are skipped by default and listed in the summary.

```text
/kit-update                # update every tracked file that's still clean
/kit-update button alert   # restrict to specific components
/kit-update --check        # report drift only — no writes
/kit-update --force        # overwrite modified files too (writes <file>.bak first)
```

The drift check uses the same normalization rules (LF endings, trailing-whitespace stripped, single trailing newline) for both written and on-disk content, so a Prettier run won't trigger spurious "modified" classifications.

## Theme commands

### `/theme-create <hex-color> [--mode=light|dark|both]`

Generate `light.css` and `dark.css` from a seed color using OKLCH palette math. Produces WCAG 2.2 AA-validated semantic role tokens.

```shell
/theme-create "#4f46e5"
/theme-create "#0f766e" --mode=light
```

### `/theme-brand <name> [--from=<hex-color>]`

Scaffold a `brand-<name>.css` file with primary/accent overrides that layer on top of `light.css` and `dark.css`.

```shell
/theme-brand forest --from="#0f766e"
/theme-brand coral
```

### `/theme-update <file> <--color-role=#hex> [...]`

Edit specific role values in an existing theme file and re-validate. Reverts any change that fails WCAG AA.

```shell
/theme-update src/styles/theme/light.css --color-primary="#2563eb"
/theme-update src/styles/theme/dark.css --color-primary="#7dd3fc" --color-focus-ring="#7dd3fc"
```

### `/theme-extract <image-path|figma-url>`

Extract brand colors from an image or Figma design and generate full theme CSS.

```shell
/theme-extract ~/Downloads/brand-moodboard.png
/theme-extract https://figma.com/design/abc123/Brand-Guide
```

### `/color-scale <color> [--name=<name>] [--format=css|json|both]`

Generate a 10-step OKLCH color scale (steps 50–900) from any seed color. Accepts a hex value, a CSS named color, or a theme role name. Output is a `:root { … }` CSS block with `var(--color-<name>-N, <hex>)` fallbacks plus a Markdown table of hex and OKLCH values per step.

```shell
/color-scale "#4f46e5"
/color-scale "#4f46e5" --name=primary
/color-scale background
/color-scale red --name=red --format=css
```

### `/style-tune <natural-language description>`

Adjust visual feel using natural language. Auto-triggers on phrases like "warmer button" / "softer card" / "more elevated dialog" — the slash form is the explicit fallback. Six v1 token families: color, radius, spacing, elevation, size, height.

```shell
/style-tune make the button feel softer and warmer
/style-tune tone down the primary color a touch
/style-tune more spacious cards
```

Theme-layer edits delegate to `/theme-update` after a pre-validation pass; component-layer edits write the targeted `--{component}-*` tokens in place. Paired roles and light/dark mirrors are atomic — either every role applies or none do.

## Help commands

### `/prompt-book [section-number]`

Print a copy-paste catalogue of natural-language prompts for every shipped slash command in `acss-kit`. Useful when you'd rather describe what you want than remember command syntax.

```shell
/prompt-book
/prompt-book 5
```

With no argument it prints the full book. With a section number it prints only that entry. The book is bundled with the plugin at [`docs/prompt-book.md`](docs/prompt-book.md), which also opens with a [**When to use what**](docs/prompt-book.md#when-to-use-what) cheat sheet for picking between `/kit-add`, `/kit-create`, `/theme-create`, `/style-tune`, and friends.

## Available components

| Category | Components | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Simple** | badge, tag, heading, text, link, list, icon, img | Leaf components |
| **Interactive** | button, icon-button | Inlined `useDisabledState` |
| **Form** | field, input, checkbox | `checkbox` depends on input |
| **Layout** | card, nav | Compound components |
| **Complex** | alert, dialog, popover, table | Varies (e.g. dialog needs button + icon-button + icon) |
| **Form (skill)** | `component-form` | Auto-triggers on form-related natural-language prompts |

Verification status against the upstream `@fpkit/acss` source is documented in the verification banner of each component's `reference.md` (e.g. `skills/component-button/reference.md`).

## Theme structure

Generated theme files follow the three-layer token cascade:

- `light.css` — semantic role tokens under `:root`
- `dark.css` — semantic role tokens under `[data-theme="dark"]`
- `brand-<name>.css` — primary/accent overrides layered on top

Toggle dark mode by setting `data-theme="dark"` on the `<html>` element.

The full CSS Token Convention — 18 defined `--color-*` properties (15 required + 3 optional), grouped by purpose, with the WCAG 2.2 AA Required Contrast Pairings table — is documented in [`skills/styles/SKILL.md`](skills/styles/SKILL.md#css-token-convention).

## Generated code characteristics

### TypeScript (.tsx)

- All types are **inlined** in the component file (never imported from other generated components).
- Imports use **local paths only** — never `@fpkit/acss`.
- The `UI` base component is always imported from `../ui`.
- Interactive components inline a condensed `useDisabledState` hook (~50 lines) for WCAG-compliant disabled handling.

### SCSS (.scss)

- All values in **rem units** (never px; conversion: px / 16 = rem).
- Every CSS variable includes a **hardcoded fallback** so components work without global tokens.
- Variants use `data-*` attribute selectors.
- Disabled state uses `[aria-disabled="true"]`.

```scss
.btn {
  font-size: var(--btn-fs, 0.9375rem);
  padding-inline: var(--btn-padding-inline, calc(var(--btn-fs, 0.9375rem) * 1.5));
  background: var(--btn-bg, transparent);
  color: var(--btn-color, currentColor);

  &[data-color="primary"] {
    background: var(--btn-primary-bg, var(--color-primary, #0066cc));
    color: var(--btn-primary-color, var(--color-text-inverse, #fff));
  }

  &[aria-disabled="true"] {
    opacity: var(--btn-disabled-opacity, 0.6);
    pointer-events: none;
  }

  &:focus-visible {
    outline: var(--btn-focus-outline, 2px solid currentColor);
    outline-offset: var(--btn-focus-outline-offset, 2px);
  }
}
```

## The UI Foundation Component

`ui.tsx` is the only file copied verbatim from fpkit. It is a polymorphic React component (~170 lines, zero dependencies beyond React) that renders as any HTML element via the `as` prop, forwards all props (including ARIA attributes), and provides type-safe refs matching the rendered element type.

All generated components build on top of `UI`. It is copied to your target directory on first `/kit-add` run and should not be deleted.

## Adding a new component (contributor recipe)

When adding or updating a component reference doc, follow the canonical embedded-markdown shape. Each component is a single markdown document — spec, code, and accessibility guidance all in one file.

### 1. Verify against fpkit source

1. Capture the current `@fpkit/acss` version: `npm view @fpkit/acss version`.
2. Resolve to the matching git tag in [`shawn-sandy/acss`](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/acss). If no matching tag exists, use the closest and note the gap.
3. Fetch the upstream source from `https://github.com/shawn-sandy/acss/blob/<tag-or-sha>/packages/fpkit/src/components/<component>/<component>.tsx` (full GitHub URL, never `blob/main`).
4. Compare upstream behavior to what you intend to vendor. Note any intentional divergence (inlined hooks, simplified compound APIs, dropped subcomponents) — these are features, not bugs.

### 2. Author the canonical sections

Run `/acss-kit-component-author <name>` to scaffold `skills/component-<name>/SKILL.md` and `skills/component-<name>/reference.md`. Or create them manually. The `reference.md` must have these sections in order:

- **Verification banner** — top-of-file blockquote starting `**Verified against fpkit source:** \`@fpkit/acss@<version>\``. Document any intentional divergence.
- **`## Overview`** — one-paragraph summary.
- **`## Generation Contract`** — `export_name`, `file`, `scss`, `imports`, `dependencies`.
- **`## Props Interface`** — TypeScript types.
- **`## TSX Template`** — fenced ```tsx``` block with the full implementation. Imports use relative paths only; never `@fpkit/acss`.
- **`## CSS Variables`** — fenced ```scss``` listing custom properties.
- **`## SCSS Template`** — fenced ```scss``` with the actual rules.
- **`## Accessibility`** — required. Cover keyboard interaction, ARIA, focus management, target size, color contrast, and the WCAG 2.2 AA criteria addressed.
- **`## Usage Examples`** — fenced ```tsx``` with common patterns.

The required `## Accessibility` section is load-bearing — don't strip a11y patterns from the TSX/SCSS. Reviewers reject reference docs without it.

### 3. Per-component skill structure

Every component ships as a `skills/component-<name>/` skill directory containing:
- `SKILL.md` — frontmatter description, 5-step workflow, reference to `reference.md`
- `reference.md` — nine canonical sections (see above)

This structure allows `/kit-add <name>` to route directly to the component's skill without going through the monolithic kit-core orchestrator.

### 4. Log verification status

Document verification status in the reference doc's verification banner at the top of `reference.md`:

```md
> **Verified against fpkit source:** `@fpkit/acss@<version>`. Intentional divergences: <none or description>.
```

This table is the single source of truth for which components have been migrated to the canonical shape.

### 5. Verify locally

For automated structural validation (the default before opening a PR):

```sh
tests/run.sh
```

This extracts the new reference doc, syntax-checks the TSX, validates the SCSS contract (var fallbacks), and confirms the manifest is intact. See [`tests/README.md`](../../tests/README.md) for first-time setup.

For end-to-end smoke testing — confirming `/kit-add <component>` actually writes a usable file — bootstrap the demo sandbox: `tests/setup.sh` from the repo root, then `cd tests/sandbox && claude` and run `/kit-add <component>`.
