# Contributing to agentic-acss-plugins

This repo hosts the Claude Code plugins for `@fpkit/acss`. The live fpkit source lives in a separate repo: [`shawn-sandy/acss`](https://github.com/shawn-sandy/acss).

## Sibling-clone workflow

Plugin work often needs to reference the fpkit source — either to check what's exported, review a component's implementation, or verify a CSS variable naming convention. Keep both repos cloned as siblings:

```
~/work/
├── acss/               # shawn-sandy/acss — live fpkit library
└── agentic-acss-plugins/       # this repo
```

The plugins do not assume this layout at runtime. All references to fpkit source in `SKILL.md` files and generated-code comments use full GitHub URLs pinned to a tag or commit SHA — never `blob/main` (e.g. `https://github.com/shawn-sandy/acss/blob/<tag-or-sha>/packages/fpkit/src/index.ts`) so plugin users need only this repo to be installed.

The sibling layout is for **contributors** editing plugin skill docs: open the fpkit source locally, verify the current exports, then update the plugin reference docs to match.

Each plugin directory follows the Claude Code plugin convention:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — manifest (name, version, description)
- `README.md` — user-facing docs
- `commands/*.md` — slash command definitions
- `skills/*/SKILL.md` — skill definitions invoked by Claude
- `skills/*/references/` — knowledge base documents where applicable
- `assets/` — templates and code snippets used by the plugin

## Maintainer tooling

The `.claude/` directory at the repo root holds project-local Claude Code definitions used while developing the plugin: review agents, authoring/release skills, validation slash commands, advisory rules, and `settings.json` hooks. See [`.claude/README.md`](./.claude/README.md) for the index — it includes an "I want to..." quick-reference table mapping common maintainer tasks to the right tool.

## Version bumps

See [the version-bumps section in `CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#version-bumps) for the authoritative rules. In short: bump the version in `plugins/<plugin>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, do **not** add a `version` field to `marketplace.json`.

## One-time setup

The test harness needs Node and Python dependencies installed once after cloning:

```sh
npm --prefix tests ci
pip3 install --user tinycss2
```

That gives `tests/run.sh` and `tests/e2e.sh` the helpers they need. Subsequent runs do not require re-installing.

## Testing locally

`tests/run.sh` from the repo root is the default structural-validation gate — ~30 seconds, no browser. It extracts each component reference, syntax-checks the TSX, validates the SCSS contract, runs WCAG contrast on themes, and replicates manifest checks.

```sh
tests/run.sh
```

For render-sensitive changes, `tests/e2e.sh` runs the deeper opt-in check — extracts components from reference docs into a temp fixture, runs `tsc --noEmit`, compiles every generated SCSS, and runs jsdom + axe-core a11y on rendered HTML. ~30s after `npm --prefix tests ci` is in place. Replaces the previous Storybook + Playwright path; the trade-off is documented in `tests/README.md` (jsdom can't measure real contrast or focus indicators — those rely on author review and `validate_theme.py`).

For end-to-end slash-command verification — when changing slash-command prose or exercising `/kit-add` and `/theme-create` interactively — `tests/setup.sh` writes a minimal verification fixture at `tests/sandbox/` (gitignored). No Vite, no app shell — just a `package.json`, a `tsconfig.json`, and an ambient SCSS module declaration. The script prints a copy-pasteable Claude Code recipe that adds the local marketplace and installs `acss-kit`.

```sh
tests/setup.sh
cd tests/sandbox && claude
```

See [`tests/README.md`](./tests/README.md) for the full workflow:

- `acss-kit` smoke flows with what to verify after each command
- A verification checklist (including `npm run build` in the sandbox)
- Reset and custom-recipe guidance
- Troubleshooting

Local-path marketplaces work the same as git-hosted ones. When satisfied, push to GitHub and let users install from `shawn-sandy/agentic-acss-plugins`.

## Before submitting a change

1. `tests/run.sh` passes from the repo root
2. `plugin.json` version bumped (see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#version-bumps))
3. SKILL.md references to fpkit source are full GitHub URLs pinned to a tag or commit SHA — never `blob/main` (see [`.claude/rules/fpkit-references.md`](./.claude/rules/fpkit-references.md))
4. `marketplace.json` description reflects any user-facing change
5. Relevant `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` (plugin-level or repo-level) updated
6. If a slash command's interactive flow changed, update the matching diagram in [`plugins/acss-kit/docs/visual-guide.md`](./plugins/acss-kit/docs/visual-guide.md)
